ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**<br>
This project simulates a real-world hospital environment where staff need instant access to accurate patient, doctor, and departmental information. The goal was to design a relational database that improves efficiency, data accuracy, and operational flow in a healthcare setting.

ðŸ›  **Tools & Technologies**<br>
MySQL Workbench, ERD & EER Diagram modeling,DDL & DML scripting,Basic to Advanced SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, Subqueries)

**ðŸ§± Features & Schema Highlights**
Tables: Patient, Doctor, Worker, Department, Diagnosis, Medication, Tests, etc.<br>
Sample DDL and INSERTs for realistic simulation

Queries written for:<br>
Retrieving patient info (age, illness, blood type, etc.)<br>
Finding worker salaries and demographics<br>
Departmental doctor distribution<br>
Test results and doctor-patient interactions<br>

**ðŸ§  Sample SQL Query Types**<br>
Basic Queries: Filter female workers, get addresses, check doses<br>
Intermediate: Aggregate salaries, count doctors per department, degree distribution<br>
Advanced: Multi-table JOINs, illness tracking, doctor-test mappings<br>

**âœ… Outcome**<br>
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with:<br>
Relational database design<br>
Writing efficient SQL queries<br>
Normalizing data and enforcing structure<br>
Preparing for roles in data analysis, database administration, and software development
