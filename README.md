ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world hospital environment where staff need instant access to accurate patient, doctor, and departmental information. The goal was to design a relational database that improves efficiency, data accuracy, and operational flow in a healthcare setting.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
MySQL Workbench

ERD & EER Diagram modeling

DDL & DML scripting

Basic to Advanced SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, Subqueries)

ðŸ§± Features & Schema Highlights
Tables: Patient, Doctor, Worker, Department, Diagnosis, Medication, Tests, etc.

Sample DDL and INSERTs for realistic simulation

Queries written for:

Finding worker salaries and demographics

Departmental doctor distribution

Test results and doctor-patient interactions

ðŸ§  Sample SQL Query Types
Basic Queries: Filter female workers, get addresses, check doses

Intermediate: Aggregate salaries, count doctors per department, degree distribution

Advanced: Multi-table JOINs, illness tracking, doctor-test mappings

âœ… Outcome
